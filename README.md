# Astrodynamics MATLAB Functions

These set of MATLAB utility functions can be used to do a variety of computations related to the fields of 
astrodynamics, statistical orbit determination, and interplanetary mission design. Each function contains a description of 
its assumptions and use cases. There are also functions that "pretty print" or "latex print" many astro-quantities, such as
position and velocity state vector matrices.
